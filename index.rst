Signing up to the Performance Platform
###########################

The following pages explain what the Performance Platform is and how to connect to it.

We believe every government service should have a dashboard. With meaningful live data you’ll be ideally placed to create great services for your users. Many service managers have found that a dashboard significantly reduces reporting overheads too.

So that government services can meet the criteria in the `Digital by Default Service Standard <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default>`_ they are required to report performance data on the `performance platform <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/performance-platform.html>`_. This guide shows you how to sign up. 

Before you start
============

Please discuss your dashboard requirements with whoever will be signing off the publication of the dashboard as soon as possible. 

We’ve found this often takes longer than the building of the dashboard itself. 


Our blog
============

We typically post a couple of times a week about new dashboards, improvements to the platform and where we’re headed. We also welcome guest blog posts!

`Visit our blog <https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/category/performance-platform/>`_

`Sign up for news by email <https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKGOVUK/subscriber/new?topic_id=UKGOVUK_6816>`_

How to get a dashboard
======================

Different services get different types of dashboard.

Transactional services
----------------------
We have a `standard dashboard <https://www.gov.uk/performance/standard-dashboard>`_ for transactional services which includes our `four mandatory KPIs <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement/index.html>`_.

- Cost per transaction (how much it costs each person to use the service)

- User satisfaction (how satisfied people feel when using the service)

- Completion rate (how many people complete the service)

- Digital take-up (percentage of people using digital options versus others)

For services using Google Analytics we’re also able to quickly add:

- number of people using the service right now

- % of device and browser types being used

- % new versus returning users

- the usage of help text

If you’re using Webtrends, Piwik or another method of collecting analytics, we can probably still help you. Please get in touch.


Non-transactional services
--------------------------
If your service is not transactional then please `get in touch <mailto:performance@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>`_ and we’ll show the other kinds of dashboards we’ve built.


How to get a standards transactional dashboard

We need eight pieces of information from you (see below).

Once we have this information we’ll publish your dashboard within 5 days to a non-linked non-searchable url.  If we’ve got any questions we’ll call you.

Keeping your dashboard up to date 
================================

You own the data in the dashboard and are responsible for maintaining its quality. 

If your dashboard is supported by an API then this data will update automatically. 

If your dashboard is supported by spreadsheet data you’ll need to regularly upload current data which will then automatically display in the dashboard. You do this using a GOV.UK Sign on account.

You’ll also be notified if the performance team expect new data to be uploaded by a certain date.


Iterating your dashboard
=======================

After your dashboard goes live there’s plenty of scope to iterate it. We’ll be in touch to arrange a ‘product audit’ to help understand what’s working for you.
